    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I still remember the first time I tried Bihari-style Litti Chokha. It was during a visit to Patna, and the
        flavors were a revelation. The smoky, roasted brinjal in the Chokha and the crisp, ghee-laden Litti were unlike
        anything I'd tasted before. It wasnâ€™t just a meal; it was an experience that transported me straight to the
        heart of Bihar.
        The Litti Chokha experience is deeply rooted in the cultural and culinary traditions of Bihar. I vividly recall
        the aroma of fresh mustard oil and the earthy fragrance of sattu stuffing. Every bite of that Litti was a
        delightful surprise, filled with a burst of flavors and a satisfying crunch. Now, I bring that same authentic
        taste to my kitchen and want to share it with you.
